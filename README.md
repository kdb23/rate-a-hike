Welcome to our Phase 2 Project: [insert name].

The requirements of this project are as follows:

1. Make a single page application using create-react-app.
2. The app should use at least 5 component in a way that keeps the code well organized.
3. There are at least 3 client-side routes using React-Router, being sure to include a nav bar or other UI elements that allows users to navigate between routes. 
4. Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for the backend and make both a GET and a POST requiest to the json server. Use a form to make a POST request. specifically a controlled form/component. Additiionally we are allowed to incorporate data from an external API if desired but not required. 
5. Add styling: this group chose to incorporate a UI framwork (React Bootstrap).
